This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First setup the .env.local file using the template I shown in the .env.sample.

Make sure to insert the access code by logging in your Facebook account to [Superheroes API](https://www.superheroapi.com/)

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
